              hash: bd8d2de9983f47e46ffa0e689be88c5b12e46617

                Since
                https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f

                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.

                In the current state the by-state symlink for balena-efi
                partition

                is not generated for two reasons:

                - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition names

                - the root device is not identified correctly in resin_update_state_probe
                  for LUKS devices

                This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state symlink

                instead of by-label.

                This patch adds the check for PCRs

                - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

                - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

                - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

                - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


                The full protection is only applied on first boot after provisioning,

                flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

                This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in the same

                state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot order is

                different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the resulting OS).

                As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully locking

                only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a secure

                environment at least once after provisioning.

                        The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security
                        configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration)

                        depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).

                        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the

                        current and target service configurations will never match. The

                        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are

                        not supported by balenaOS.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        With this change the aufs data is kept around until the
                        next time we

                        start. If we find both an aufs AND an overlay2 storage root, we cleanup

                        the aufs data.

                        vulnerable to the same issues.

                        If the engine process is terminated during the layer
                        extraction transaction,

                        before Commit or Cancel is called on the transaction, a new FS layer can be created

                        by the graph driver without any link to the layers metadata.


                        This change ensures we don't perform any actions on the graph driver storage until

                        the FS layer ID (the cacheID) is  persisted as a part of the transaction data.


                        We can use this data to clean up the graph driver storage on next process start

                        deleting all data associated with the transactions terminated abruptly.

                The prepare-openvpn service needs to be restarted to regenerate
                the

                VPN keys when provisioning is finished and the `apiKey` is removed.


                Note that flasher images make changes to `/mnt/boottmp/config.json` so

                we still need to manually kick `prepare-openvpn` in

                `resin-device-register`, which is preferable to modifying services to

                watch multiple paths.

                Avoid additional wait and API call when we already have the

                This might also resolve a race condition that has been difficult to

                track down.

                Upstream kernel added a new fkms overlay for
                the Pi4 and CM4 and switched to using it
                from overlay-map, however, we were not aware
                of this.

                Let's add a vcdbg testcase to warn in case the RPi
                firmware fails to load any overlay or dtb, and set
                gpu_mem to 64 so that vcdbg can run.

              hash: 13cf7c9fef0a6e0df6b042ba34ceaa7a0d005254
              body: >
                We want the VPN to start unconditionally even if the
                connectivity URL

                is not reachable.


                The rationale for adding the dependency in the first place was that

                without an initial timesync certificate checks may fail. This can still

                happen, but the VPN will retry continuously and eventually succeed once

                the time is synched.


                What happens now is that the VPN is delayed until the http sync, so if

                the connectivity URL is blocked or unreachable, but the internet is

                accessible, VPN will not even launch and no remote debugging is possible.


                Fixes #2508

                per-unit configuration files extracts.


                These will then be monitored by the respective service units to trigger

                restarts, so that service units will only be restarted when there are

                configuration changes that apply to them.

                Unit files that are configured via config.json and want to be
                restarted

                on config.json changes are part of this target.


                This causes a burst of service restarts each time config.json changes,

                independently of whether the configuration changes applies to the unit

                or not.


                This commit removes all config-json.target instances in preparation for

                the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

                to use a custom stage2 bootloader. Since that is not ready yet, emulate that

                by copying flasher kernel to the EFI partition, start it from GRUB, have it

                unlock all the partitions, find the real kernel and kexec into it.

                We add this this check since we discovered
                that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
                not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

                We don't mark the test as failed in
                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                Let's only apply this code to pre-warrior as intended. Starting
                with warrior this code is in poky so we can rely on it from
                there instead of keeping a duplicate in meta-balena-common.
                This helps with BSPs that may define their own tasks (configure,
                compile and so on) for u-boot (keeping this fragments merging
                code in meta-balena-common would have the effect of overwriting
                these tasks from here and thus breaking the build).

                jq is used in the bootfiles hostapp-update
                hook for accessing config.json, which may have
                one of the modification dates invalid,
                as we've seen during testing. We thus need to
                avoid performing a touch on config.json
                to avoid reloading of containers.

              body: >
                The chrony driftfile is not being updated at shutdown due to an

                incorrect mount service dependency in the systemd chronyd.service

                file. The current dependency on 'var-volatile-lib' does not cover the

                subsequent bind mounting of the '/var/lib/chrony' sub-directory, so

                the chrony directory gets unmounted at shutdown before the drift file

                has been updated.


                This issue is solved by changing the mount service dependency from

                'var-volatile-lib' to 'bind-var-lib-chrony' (which is similar to the

                way bind mount dependencies are already handled for the NetworkManager

                and bluetooth services).

                Newer ones should prefer v1.54, which is the latest rust
                version to use the Honister syntax.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not

                there.


                Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use /tmp

                to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

                generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


                However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is recreated

                on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems for DM

                devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not re-processed

                by udevd.


                This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may implement

                disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains backwards

                compatible for HUP from older releases.

                Some BSPs name the u-boot such as u-boot-imx_2020 for example.
                Because of that, our existing bbappend called u-boot_%.bbappend
                will not match it and will fail to be applied.
                This PR is a first pass at solving this by moving at least the
                SRC_URI appending part from this bbappend and into the
                resin-u-boot.bbclass instead. Further investigation is needed
                to see if we can remove this bbappend altogether since we may
                have all boards using Poky Warrior or newer, making this
                u-boot bbappend obsolete.

                The CM4 IO-Board was the first device
                which exhibited an issue in which
                the MAC address was set to an
                unprogrammed value AA:AA:AA...:AA.

                We've addressed this in the device repo,
                meanwhile it has been fixed in upstream
                too, so let's check and catch this should
                it happen again.

                anymore therefore we can safely remove it.

                This patch replaces the kernel being shipped with the one that
                we eventually

                sign for EFI - without signing the original file used would be identical

                but after applying signature, the signed version is the one we want to ship.


                It also fixes the file name for the detached signature, which must match

                the name of the associated file.

              hash: 2bb18707557979ed6466f45602de4ecf5b386c57
              body: >
                Add a new timesync-https systemd service to synchronise the
                system

                time at boot using an HTTPS header. The service uses curl to request

                an HTTPS header from either $API_ENDPOINT/connectivity-check (default)

                or the URL defined by the os.network.connectivity.uri field in

                config.json. The URL used *must* return HTTP code 204 (No Content)

                in response to a request so that we can determine that we have full

                network connectivity and are not operating behind a captive portal.


                The date field returned by a valid header is used to set the current

                system time. The date/time derived from the header is assumed to be a

                reasonable source of 'truth' such that it can be used to adjust the

                system time both backwards and forwards. This will compensate for any

                erroneous timestamps saved via fake-hwclock or any invalid data

                read from an RTC.


                The service will exit when a valid response has been received. Poll

                attempts will be made at an increasing interval starting at 2s and

                doubling up to a maximum of 64s. Polling will continue at the maximum

                interval until a valid response has been received.


                This service will provide initial time synchronisation for devices

                where NTP ports have been blocked. For devices where NTP access is

                available it should ensure that any system 'time jump' is only a few

                seconds when NTP synchronisation is eventually achieved. It also

                allows other services to start with a reasonably accurate time

                without having to wait for the NTP synchronisation process to

                complete.


                Services that are ordered after the new time-sync-https-wait target

                can be sure that full network connectivity has been achieved and that

                time has been synchronised with an accuracy of a few seconds.

                When udev runs resin_update_state_probe for a non-balena
                partition

                and ENV{ID_PART_ENTRY_NAME} is undefined it still gets expanded to random

                garbage accidentally lying at the eventual memory address. This can create

                a mess in /dev/disk/by-state e.g. when external devices are connected.

                The interface test uses a simple ping to ensure a specific
                interface

                works. It sends ten packets, and expects ten packets back. However, the

                default interval is one second, which increases the time taken for the

                test while not adding anything of value.


                Reduce the timeout to the minimum non-privileged interval of 2ms.

                The hook tries to read EFI variables from efivarfs but this is
                not always

                mounted within the container. We have already validated that we are running

                in EFI mode therefore we can just check whether it is already mounted

                and eventually mount with no further checks.


                This also adds graceful handling of nonexistent variables since not all

                UEFI implementations come with secure boot support.

                At this moment GRUB drops to rescue shell if config is invalid

                or if signatures are missing/wrong. This lets the user disable the signature

                checks altogether.


                With this patch GRUB outputs nothing and accepts no user input if signing

                is configured.

                approach and we will look for a clean solution.

                GRUB can not use the TPM easily to unlock the volumes and find
                the kernel

                on an encrypted partition. Instead, we choose to store a linux kernel

                and use it as 2nd stage bootloader to unlock the partition, load the actual

                kernel and kexec into it. This should eventually be replaced by a proper

                2nd stage bootloader that is being worked on.

                Currently the two classes would keep the original files
                untouched and store

                the signed versions as .signed. This patch reverses the logic - the signed

                files replace the original ones and the unsigned version is stored as .unsigned.

                This is because there is no real use-case for the unsigned files, we always

                want to ship the signed version, even if the particular DT does not require it,

                this causes no harm.

                module. However, the endpoint returned the address for the testbot to be

                used as the proxy in the response, and this required manual

                configuration of the interface. Additionally, it requires the worker

                service to install and provide glider for forward proxying.


                Move the proxy (glider) to a container on the device being tested,

                which simplifies configuration, and reduces the complexity and size of

                the interface of Leviathan.

                Add a test to wait for the chronyd service to become active
                before

                starting the time sync tests.


                The current chronyd tests assume that the chronyd service is

                instantly available at boot time. With the addition of the new

                HTTPS time synchronisation service the starting of chronyd can be

                delayed by a few seconds so we need to ensure that the service

                is actually running before proceeding.

        Let's disable it to test the rest of the functionality.

                As per https://jel.ly.fish/a533a6bd-1c98-412c-ae60-8427e3f7b005,
                the /device-types/v1 endpoint is deprecated and we can remove
                the logo from the device repos so we can also stop handling it
                from here. Instead, the logo will be used from the hw contracts.

                last meta-balena tag.


                For example, when we branch an ESR release, the meta-balena branch is

                tagged with the ESR name, like 2.83.x, while the last meta-balena version

                will be a proper semver.

                For the time being we are still using a version label in the hostapp.

                The previous commit moved the preloaded image out of yocto
                cache, which

                made it unreachable from the balena-generate-ami-env container.


                This patch makes mktemp create the file back within yocto cache to ensure

                this is shared yet still each concurrent process can safely have its own copy.

                Since the file name is hardcoded at this moment, this fails when
                two

                builds are running in parallel (e.g. dev and prod variants during deploy)

                because they try to preload the same file at pretty much the same moment.

                Having a separate copy for each outside of yocto cache should fix the issue.

                Currently we are reading a package list from the contracts that
                mixes

                recipe and package names, and we run bitbake with the `-k` flag not to

                stop the build when a package name fails to match a recipe.


                The contracts have now been modified to specify either a `sw.recipe.yocto`

                or a `sw.package.yocto` so we can distinguish between them and use

                recipe names to build and package names to install.


                We also remove the continue flag from bitbake.

                This is

                too long for the creation of per-task balena-engine sockets which have

                a maximum path length of 104 characters.


                This commit replaces the installation directory with "/work".

                The code originates from poky's master branch -

                is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by

                versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to

                When running multiple daemons, we don't want them to clash
                managing

                false.

                By default we enable both which is the current dockerd default.

                When running a single docker daemon without the iptables and ipmasq flags,

                containers on the default bridge network cannot communite with the

                outside as no iptables rules are set.

                script.

                Also, fix the length of the short git release to avoid different git

                clients configuration mismatches.

        This updated version installs a newer docker version in the
        yocto-build-env helper container that has networking issues when run in
        a docker in docker configuration with the docker 17.05.0-ce available in
        the Ubuntu 17.04 builder nodes.

        This will need to be resolved before updating.

              hash: 5e1004d6753025166c40b11af117e008feb875f1
              body: >
                grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition,
                and

                resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.


                A normal grub installation installs those modules to ${PREFIX}/${libdir}

                to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're building the

                image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.


                The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these

                constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to

                ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This had the

                unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases, such as

                clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps of the

                build.


                Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append the

                required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub image

                without any external modules at all.

                is defined

                as UUID=xxx the waiting loop in rootfs initrd script would assume UUIDs have

                just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead. This only works

                for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated UUIDs

                therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                Update the existing DHCP dispatcher script for adding NTP
                sources to

                make use of dynamic chrony source configuration. Any DHCP configured

                NTP sources for a particular interface are added to a sources file on

                network 'up' or DHCP lease renewal events. Any DHCP configured NTP

                sources for a particular interface are deleted on network 'down'

                events. Changes to the sources file are picked up by chrony either

                when it starts up or at runtime using the chrony-helper script.


                Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline

                status on network 'up' and 'down' events. This will make chrony

                re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network interface

                comes back up.

                dynamic source configuration files. Any NTP source files that are

                created in 'sourcedir' (/run/chrony) can be used to update the chrony

                source configuration at runtime.


                Add a helper script to support the dynamic re-loading of chrony

                sources. This script uses the chrony 'reload sources' feature.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package compile properly:


                Removed is 0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

              hash: 00556af37cf241e2b95d9b719f1ab58cc9bbddb6

                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary into

                a separate procps package:


                - https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=507a47a4e5077d5f8f76d9629be6b871dfd8eb90


                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than gatesgarth.

              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c

                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle
                and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                The file rename happened in v2.51 but the README has not been

                accordingly.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and
                use the one from the upstream Poky project instead.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                Upstream changes to the kernel have switched to a shared x86

                insn decoder required by tools/objtool so we must add those

                include and lib components to our target dir.

                Update chrony from version 3.4 to version 4.0.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.
